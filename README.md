# C++ Project using the ncurses library
This was a test project using the ncurses library.  This was also my first experience with c++.

I am planning to make a game witn ncurses in the future



# Installation
Here are the commands to install the ncurses library on different linux distros:

### Debian/Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora 21 or older

sudo yum install ncurses-devel

### Fedora 22.x+

sudo dnf install ncurses-devel



To build the source code, just run *make* and then run the executable using *./game*

(I haven't tested any of this outside ubuntu)
